It was requested that we include two potential solutions. 
It was also requested that we interview potential participants with
  regards to our proposed solutions.

Points to hit on the presentation
  * What benefits do our proposed frameworks offer? Drawbacks?
  * What will the vendors need in order to upload their information 
    to the system? (not much)
  * What role does tokenization play in each framework?
  * Will it be possible to keep sensitive information private? (yes)
  * What kind of feedback did we get from the interviewees?
  * How does IBM Food Trust work? (at a high level)

Tokenization was stressed heavily in the description of our project. 
We need to make sure different methods of incentivization are covered
throughout our presentation.
  * Will smart contracts be incorporated?
  * Will kind of say will vendors have in token usage?
  * Should these tokens expire at some point?
  * How will tokens be given out?
    - Number of transactions?
    - Frequency of transactions?
    - Amount of information shared?
    - Consistency of quality delivered?
